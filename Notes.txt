Introdutction
---------------------------------------------
Snapshot: 
 Snapshot means capturing the state of the storage system at an exact point in time and is used to provide full
recovery of data when lost.

Big Data Systems & Enterprise-Grade Storage Systems
  Apache Hadoop, Cassandra, HBase 

Use-Case Scenarios
---------------------------------------------
Software Upgrades:

Rollback from Errors:
  Operational as well as analytical applications manipulate the data in the distributed file system on behalf of the user or the administrator. Application-level errors or even inadvertent user errors can mistakenly delete data or modify data in an unexpected way. In this case, snapshots can be used to recover to a known, well-defined state.

Hot Backups:
  With snapshots, it is possible to create backups on the fly, often required for auditing or compliance reasons
 
Managing Real-time Data Analysis:
  By using snapshots, query engines like Apache Drill can produce precise synchronic summaries of data sources subject to constant updates such as sensor data or social media streams. Using a snapshot for such analyses allows very precise comparisons to be done across multiple ever-changing data sources without having to stop real-time data ingestion.

HDFS v2 Architecture
---------------------------------------------

Page 1 in HOP_Schema.pdf in Thesis/Documentation folder.



HOP-HDFS Architecture
---------------------------------------------
  1.Our solution involves storing the metadata in a replicated, distributed, in-memory database that can scale up to several tens of nodes, all while maintaining the consistency semantics of HDFS
  2.Multiple-Reader and Multiple-Writer concurrency model.
  3.Multiple concurrent writers are now supported for the filesystem as a whole, but single-writer concurrency is enforced at the inode level
